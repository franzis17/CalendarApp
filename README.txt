The Gradle Wrapper
==================

** Delete this file once you understand. **

This is a standalone copy of the "Gradle wrapper", which you can use to initialise a new Gradle
project, even if you don't have Gradle installed. Rename the main "gradle_wrapper" directory (not 
the subdirectories) so that it reflects your project, then run:

$ ./gradlew init

You can change the version of Gradle being used by editing the file
"gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties". You should see "gradle-X.Y.Z-bin.zip", and you can
simply change this version number to any other Gradle version. You can find the latest Gradle
release, see https://gradle.org/releases/.
